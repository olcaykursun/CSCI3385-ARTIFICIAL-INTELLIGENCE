Read the texture image files from the URL and perform a sample snip:

[read_img_from_url](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16qv502nRc6m93_iDobLEz3otVAM-fZxk)


Or you can copy the file to your Drive and mount it in Colab:

       from google.colab import drive           
       drive.mount('/content/gdrive')      
       mydirectory = 'gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/texture2/'
